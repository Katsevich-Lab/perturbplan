\title{Calculate power grid for app heatmap visualization (lightweight)}
\usage{
calculate_power_grid(
  fc_expression_info,
  cells_reads_df,
  fdr_target = 0.05,
  prop_non_null = 0.1,
  side = "left"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fc_expression_info}{List from extract_fc_expression_info() containing fc_expression_df and expression_dispersion_curve}

\item{cells_reads_df}{Data frame with pre-computed experimental design containing
reads_per_cell, num_trt_cells, num_cntrl_cells, and library_size columns.
Must be provided (from identify_cell_read_range() -> convert_design_to_dataframe()).}

\item{fdr_target}{FDR target level}

\item{prop_non_null}{Proportion of non-null pairs}

\item{side}{Test sidedness ("left", "right", "both")}
}
\value{
List with power grid, cell/read sequences
}
\description{
This function provides lightweight power analysis for the Shiny application heatmap.
It only computes overall power for each cell/read combination, not detailed curves.
Use calculate_power_curves() for detailed curve computation on selected tiles.
