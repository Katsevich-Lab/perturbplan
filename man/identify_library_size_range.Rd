\title{Identify optimal reads per cell range for power analysis grid}
\usage{
identify_library_size_range(experimental_platform, library_info)
}
\arguments{
\item{experimental_platform}{Character. Experimental platform identifier
(e.g., "10x Chromium v3", "Other").}

\item{library_info}{List. Output from extract_library_info() containing
UMI_per_cell and variation parameters for S-M curve analysis.}
}
\value{
List with elements:
\describe{
\item{min_reads_per_cell}{Minimum reads per cell based on platform}
\item{max_reads_per_cell}{Maximum reads per cell for ~80\% UMI saturation}
}
}
\description{
This function determines the minimum and maximum reads per cell values for
power analysis grid generation based on experimental platform capabilities
and S-M curve saturation analysis.
}
\details{
This function is a wrapper around the optimized C++ implementation
\code{identify_library_size_range_cpp} which provides significant
performance improvements for power analysis computations.

The function operates in two phases:

\strong{Minimum determination}: Platform-specific minimum sequencing depth
based on typical experimental capabilities and quality thresholds.

\strong{Maximum determination}: Uses binary search on the S-M curve to find
the reads per cell that achieves approximately 80\% UMI saturation. If
80\% saturation is not achievable within practical limits (10x UMI_per_cell),
returns the practical upper bound.
