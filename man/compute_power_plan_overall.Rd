\title{Compute overall power for power analysis (lightweight computation)}
\usage{
compute_power_plan_overall(
  num_trt_cells,
  num_cntrl_cells,

  multiple_testing_alpha = 0.05,
  multiple_testing_method = "BH",

}
\arguments{
\item{num_trt_cells}{Number of treatment cells (pre-computed)}

\item{num_cntrl_cells}{Number of control cells (pre-computed)}

\item{library_size}{Library size (reads per cell)}

\item{multiple_testing_alpha}{Alpha level for multiple testing}

\item{multiple_testing_method}{Multiple testing method}

\item{side}{Test sidedness}

\item{fc_expression_df}{Data frame with fold change and expression info}

\item{prop_non_null}{Proportion of non-null hypotheses}

\item{return_full_results}{If TRUE, return list with all intermediate results; if FALSE, return only overall power}
}
\value{
Overall power value (scalar) or list with full results depending on return_full_results
}
\description{
This function computes overall power and BH cutoff without expensive curve calculations.
Used for heatmap generation and as a base for detailed curve computation.
Treatment and control cell counts should be pre-computed.
