}
\arguments{
\item{num_trt_cells}{Number of treatment cells}

\item{num_cntrl_cells}{Number of control cells}

\item{library_size}{Library size (effective UMIs per cell)}

\item{multiple_testing_alpha}{Alpha level for multiple testing (default: 0.05)}

\item{multiple_testing_method}{Multiple testing method (default: "BH")}

\item{side}{Test sidedness ("left", "right", "both", default: "left")}

\item{fc_expression_df}{Data frame with fold change and expression info}

\item{prop_non_null}{Proportion of non-null hypotheses (default: 0.1)}

\item{return_full_results}{If TRUE, return list with all intermediate results; if FALSE, return only overall power}
}
\value{
Overall power value (scalar) or list with full results depending on return_full_results
}
\description{
This function computes overall power and BH cutoff for a single experimental design.
This is a core utility function used by grid-based power analysis functions.
}
\details{
This function serves as the core power calculation utility that:
\itemize{
\item Computes test statistic distributions for each gene
\item Applies Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction
\item Calculates overall statistical power
}

The function delegates to the optimized C++ implementation for performance.
