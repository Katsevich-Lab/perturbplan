\usage{
reference_data_preprocessing_10x(
  path_to_top_level_output,
  path_to_run_level_output = NULL,
  h5_rough = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_to_top_level_output}{Character. Path to the top-level directory
containing Cell Ranger run-level subdirectories, each with multiple SRR subdirectories}

\item{path_to_run_level_output}{Optional character vector. Subset of specific
run-level directories to include. If not found within the top-level path,
unmatched entries will trigger a warning.}

\item{h5_rough}{Logical. Whether to extract h5 molecular information from only
the first SRR (TRUE) or from all SRRs and combine them (FALSE). Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
\item{response_matrix}{Combined gene expression matrix with consistent genes across SRRs.}
\item{h5_data}{QC and molecule-level data extracted from HDF5 files.}
}
}
\description{
Aggregates gene expression response matrices and molecular information
from multiple SRR-level Cell Ranger output folders, extracting common genes
and aligning them into a unified response matrix. Optionally processes only a
subset of run-level folders, and summarizes gene consistency across SRRs.
}
\details{
This function:
\enumerate{
\item Identifies all run-level and SRR-level directories.
\item Extracts gene expression matrices from each SRR via \code{obtain_qc_response_data}.
\item Intersects gene sets to ensure consistency across all SRRs.
\item Extracts h5 QC data from either one or all SRRs via \code{obtain_qc_h5_data}.
