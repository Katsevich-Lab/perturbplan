\title{Aggregate Expression and QC Data from Multiple SRR-Level Cell Ranger Outputs}
\usage{
reference_data_preprocessing_10x(
  path_to_top_level_output,
  path_to_run_level_output = NULL,
  h5_rough = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_to_top_level_output}{Character. Path to the top-level directory
containing Cell Ranger run-level subdirectories.}

\item{path_to_run_level_output}{Optional character vector. A subset of run-level
directory names (not full paths). These should match the basename of folders
inside \code{path_to_top_level_output}. Unmatched entries will trigger a warning.}

\item{h5_rough}{Logical. If TRUE (default), h5 data will only be extracted from
the first SRR folder. If FALSE, data from all SRRs will be combined.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{response_matrix}{A matrix of gene expression values (common genes only),
combined across SRR directories.}
\item{read_umi_table}{A data frame of molecule-level QC data from one or more SRRs,
including the SRR label.}
\item{mapping_efficiency}{A numeric value representing the mapping efficiency}
}
}
\description{
This function aggregates gene expression matrices and h5 molecule-level data
from multiple SRR-level Cell Ranger output directories. It aligns all matrices
to a common set of genes, performs basic consistency checks, and optionally
restricts to a user-defined subset of run-level directories.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Lists all SRR directories under the given top-level folder.
\item Optionally filters to a subset of run-level names.
\item Reads response matrices and retains only shared genes across SRRs.
\item Optionally reads h5 QC data from one or all SRRs.
