\title{Compute power grid for overall power analysis (no curves)}
\usage{
compute_power_grid_overall(
  cells_reads_df,
  fc_expression_info,
  library_info,
  fdr_target = 0.05,
  prop_non_null = 0.1,
  side = "left"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cells_reads_df}{Data frame with columns num_total_cells, reads_per_cell, num_trt_cells, and num_cntrl_cells}

\item{fc_expression_info}{List from extract_fc_expression_info() containing fc_expression_df and expression_dispersion_curve}

\item{library_info}{List from extract_library_info() containing UMI_per_cell and variation parameters}

\item{fdr_target}{Target false discovery rate}

\item{prop_non_null}{Proportion of non-null hypotheses}

\item{side}{Test sidedness ("left", "right", "both")}
}
\value{
Data frame with power analysis results (overall power only)
}
\description{
This function computes only overall power for each cell/read combination
without the expensive curve calculations. Used for heatmap generation.
Experimental design parameters (MOI, control group, etc.) should be pre-computed
into treatment and control cell counts in the cells_reads_df.
