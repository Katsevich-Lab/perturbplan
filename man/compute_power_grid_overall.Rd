\item{tpm_threshold}{TPM threshold (currently unused)}

\item{fdr_target}{Target false discovery rate}

\item{prop_non_null}{Proportion of non-null hypotheses}

\value{
Data frame with power analysis results (overall power only)
}
\description{
This function computes only overall power for each cell/read combination
without the expensive curve calculations. Used for heatmap generation.
