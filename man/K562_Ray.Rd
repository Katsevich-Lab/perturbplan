\description{
Pre-computed pilot data from K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells generated
using TAP-seq (targeted perturb-seq) with 10x Chromium technology. Contains
baseline gene expression parameters and library size information for power
analysis of CRISPR-based perturbation experiments. TAP-seq uses targeted
sequencing to profile a focused gene panel, providing cost-effective power
analysis for experiments targeting specific pathways or gene sets.
}
\details{
This dataset was generated using DC TAP-seq (Direct-Capture Targeted Perturb-seq),
an enhanced version of targeted perturb-seq that integrates CRISPR-based perturbations
with direct-capture single-cell RNA sequencing. By capturing guide RNAs alongside
targeted gene transcripts within the same sequencing reaction, DC TAP-seq enables
high-throughput, unbiased mapping of distal regulatory element–gene interactions
with improved sensitivity and reduced technical noise. This approach allows
simultaneous measurement of perturbation identity and gene expression in thousands
of single cells, facilitating large-scale functional dissection of noncoding regions
at single-cell resolution.

\strong{Cells Used in Relative Expression Estimate:} All cells in high-moi condition
