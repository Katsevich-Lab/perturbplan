\description{
Pre-computed pilot data from K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells generated
using TAP-seq (targeted perturb-seq) with 10x Chromium technology. Contains
baseline gene expression parameters and library size information for power
analysis of CRISPR-based perturbation experiments. TAP-seq uses targeted
sequencing to profile a focused gene panel, providing cost-effective power
analysis for experiments targeting specific pathways or gene sets.
}
\details{
This dataset was generated from K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells using
TAP-seq (targeted perturb-seq), which combines CRISPR perturbations with
targeted single-cell RNA sequencing. Unlike genome-wide perturb-seq, TAP-seq
focuses sequencing resources on a pre-defined gene panel, enabling deeper
coverage of targeted genes at lower cost.

\strong{Cells Used in Relative Expression Estimate:} All cells in high-moi condition
