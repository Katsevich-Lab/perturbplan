\title{Compute experimental cost for perturb-seq experiments}
\usage{
cost_computation(
  experimental_platform = "10x Chromium v3",
  sequencing_platform = "NovaSeq X 25B",
  num_captured_cells,
  raw_reads_per_cell
)
}
\arguments{
\item{experimental_platform}{Character. The experimental platform used for single-cell capture.
Currently supported: "10x Chromium v3" (default).}

\item{sequencing_platform}{Character. The sequencing platform used for RNA-seq.
Currently supported: "NovaSeq X 25B" (default).}

\item{num_captured_cells}{Numeric. Number of captured cells in the experiment.}

\item{raw_reads_per_cell}{Numeric. Number of raw sequencing reads per cell.}
}
\value{
Numeric. Total experimental cost in USD combining library preparation and sequencing costs.
}
\description{
This function calculates the total cost of a perturb-seq experiment by combining
library preparation costs and sequencing costs based on the experimental platform,
sequencing platform, number of captured cells, and raw reads per cell.
}
\details{
The cost calculation includes two main components:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Library preparation cost}: Based on cost per captured cell for the experimental platform
\item \strong{Sequencing cost}: Based on cost per million reads for the sequencing platform
}

Current cost parameters:
\itemize{
\item 10x Chromium v3: $0.086 per captured cell
\item NovaSeq X 25B: $0.374 per million reads
}

Total cost = (cost_per_captured_cell × num_captured_cells) +
(cost_per_million_reads × raw_reads_per_cell × num_captured_cells / 1e6)
}
\examples{
# Calculate cost for a typical experiment
cost_computation(
  experimental_platform = "10x Chromium v3",
  sequencing_platform = "NovaSeq X 25B",
  num_captured_cells = 10000,
  raw_reads_per_cell = 50000
)
}
